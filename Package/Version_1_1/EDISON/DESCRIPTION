Description: Package EDISON (Estimation of Directed Interactions from
    Sequences Of Nonhomogeneous gene expression) runs an MCMC
    simulation to reconstruct networks from time series data, using
    a non-homogeneous, time-varying dynamic Bayesian network.
    Networks segments and changepoints are inferred concurrently,
    and information sharing priors provide a reduction of the
    inference uncertainty.
