Estimation of Directed Interactions from Sequences Of Nonhomogeneous gene expression

The R package EDISON runs an MCMC simulation to reconstruct networks from time series data, using a non-homogeneous, time-varying dynamic Bayesian network. Networks segments and changepoints are inferred concurrently, and information sharing priors provide a reduction of the inference uncertainty.

For model description, see:

Dondelinger et al. (2012), "Non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks with Bayesian regu-
larization for inferring gene regulatory networks with gradually time-varying structure", Machine
Learning.
